const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How do I book an appointment?",
    a: "Use the booking form on our Artists page to request a date/time with your preferred artist. We’ll review your idea, confirm availability, and send deposit instructions to secure the spot."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you require a deposit?",
    a: "Yes. Deposits are required to hold your appointment and are applied to the final cost. Deposits are non-refundable but transferable once with 48 hours’ notice."
  },
  {
    q: "What forms of payment do you accept?",
    a: "We accept cash and major cards. Tips are appreciated and can be given in cash or card at your discretion."
  },
  {
    q: "How is pricing determined?",
    a: "Pricing depends on size, placement, complexity, and the artist’s rate. Small, simple pieces may have a shop minimum. Large or multi-session work is typically billed hourly."
  },
  {
    q: "What is your cancellation / reschedule policy?",
    a: "Please give at least 48 hours’ notice to reschedule once without losing your deposit. No-shows or late cancellations forfeit the deposit."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I bring reference images?",
    a: "Absolutely—references help us understand your vision. Your artist will design a custom piece that fits your anatomy and style while keeping the concept intact."
  },
  {
    q: "Will you tattoo hands, necks, or faces?",
    a: "These areas are considered advanced placements. Approval is at the artist’s discretion and may require an in-person consultation."
  },
  {
    q: "Does it hurt? Can I use numbing cream?",
    a: "Discomfort varies by person and placement. Over-the-counter numbing creams can affect skin texture and healing; if you plan to use one, discuss it with your artist first."
  },
  {
    q: "How should I prepare for my appointment?",
    a: "Hydrate, get good sleep, and eat a full meal. Avoid alcohol or blood thinners for 24 hours. Wear clean, comfortable clothing that exposes the area being tattooed."
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a tattoo take to heal?",
    a: "Initial surface healing is ~1–2 weeks, with deeper healing up to 4–6 weeks. Follow our aftercare to keep your tattoo clean, moisturized, and out of direct sun while healing."
  },
  {
    q: "What aftercare do you recommend?",
    a: "We’ll provide written aftercare at your appointment. Generally: keep the bandage on as directed, wash gently with fragrance-free soap, pat dry, and apply a thin layer of unscented moisturizer."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I swim or tan after getting tattooed?",
    a: "Avoid pools, hot tubs, oceans, and baths until fully healed. Keep your tattoo out of direct sun and skip tanning; UV breaks down pigment and can cause fading."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you do touch-ups?",
    a: "Yes. If you follow aftercare and need a small touch-up within a set time window, many artists include one; policies vary by artist, so please ask at your appointment."
  },
  {
    q: "What if I have allergies or sensitive skin?",
    a: "Tell your artist about any skin sensitivities, allergies (latex, nickel, adhesives), or medical conditions. We use professional inks and single-use sterilized needles."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you tattoo minors?",
    a: "Policies vary by jurisdiction and artist. A government-issued ID is always required; additional documents may be needed. Call ahead to confirm current requirements."
